##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
##    they can connect to you.                              ##
##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
##                                                          ##
##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
##                                                          ##
##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
##       Thanks goes to [Noodle] on Freenode.               ##

## JSON-RPC options (for controlling a running Zcash/zcashd process)
##

# server=1 tells zcashd to accept JSON-RPC commands (set as default if not specified)
#server=1

# Bind to given address to listen for JSON-RPC connections. Use [host]:port notation for IPv6.
# This option can be specified multiple times (default: bind to all interfaces)

# You must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api

# How many seconds zcash will wait for a complete RPC HTTP request.

#rpcclienttimeout=30

# By default, only RPC connections from localhost are allowed.
# Specify as many rpcallowip= settings as you like to allow connections from other hosts,
# either as a single IPv4/IPv6 or with a subnet specification.

# NOTE: opening up the RPC port to hosts outside your local trusted network is NOT RECOMMENDED,
# because the rpcpassword is transmitted over the network unencrypted and also because anyone
# that can authenticate on the RPC port can steal your keys + take over the account running zcashd
# For more information see https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1497

#rpcallowip=10.1.1.34/255.255.255.0

## Miscellaneous options
##

# Enable attempt to CPU-mine zcash. This is only useful on testnet.
#gen=0

# Set the number of threads to be used for mining zcash (-1 = all cores).

# Specify a different Equihash solver (e.g. "tromp") to try to mine zcash

# Pre-generate this many public/private key pairs, so wallet backups will be valid for
# both prior transactions and several dozen future transactions.
