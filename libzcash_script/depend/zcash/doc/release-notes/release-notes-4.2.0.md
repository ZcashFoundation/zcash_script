Notable changes
===============

Switch to ed25519-zebra for consensus signature checks
------------------------------------------------------
This removes the zcashd dependency upon libsodium for ed25519
signature checks and instead uses the Rust implementation in
ed25519-zebra, which has been active for signature verification
since the Canopy upgrade. For more information on the conditions
that led to this change see https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am

Update default fees according to ZIP-313
----------------------------------------
Reduce default fees to 0.00001 ZEC as specified in ZIP-313 and 
ensure that transactions paying at least the new minimum fee meet
the transaction relay threshold irrespective of transaction size.

Improve getblocktemplate rpc performance when using shielded coinbase
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This change precomputes future block templates to permit miners to
begin working atop newly arrived blocks as quickly as possible, rather
than waiting for a new template to be generated after a block has arrived.
It also reduces the initial the wait time for incorporating new mempool 
transactions into a block from 1 minute to 10 seconds; the previous value
was inherited from the upstream bitcoin codebase but is inappropriate for
our block timing.

Migrate from rpc-tests.sh to rpc-tests.py
-----------------------------------------
This unifies and simplifies the RPC testing framework, as has
been done in the upstream Bitcoin codebase.

      Windows cross-build generates .lib files, which should be ignored by git and removed by clean.
      Partial revert of "Update links". See #4904
      Fix a typo introduced in #4904.
      Reduce the default fee for z_* operations, and the "low fee penalty" threshold for mempool limiting, to 1000 zatoshis.
      Always allow transactions paying at least DEFAULT_FEE to be relayed, and do not rate-limit them. In other words, make sure that the "minimum relay fee" is no greater than DEFAULT_FEE.
      gtest/test_mempoollimit: the test failed to properly ensure that the "low fee penalty" threshold matches the new ZIP 313 fee.
      Revert changes in #4916 that assumed arguments represent fees, when they are actually number of confirmations.
