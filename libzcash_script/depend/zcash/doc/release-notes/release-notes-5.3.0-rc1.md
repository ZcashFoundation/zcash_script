Wallet Performance Improvements
-------------------------------

`zcashd 5.2.0` improved the performance of wallet scanning with multithreaded
batched trial decryption of Sapling outputs. However, for some nodes this
resulted in growing memory usage that would eventually cause an OOM abort. We
have identified the cause of the growth, and made significant improvements to
reduce the memory usage of the batch scanner. In addition, the batch scanner now
has a memory limit of 100 MiB.

`zcashd` now reports the following new metrics when `-prometheusport` is set:

- (counter) `zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.outputs.scanned`
- (gauge) `zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.size.transactions`
- (gauge) `zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.usage.bytes`
- (gauge) `zcashd.wallet.synced.block.height`

RPC Interface
-------------

- The `finalorchardroot` field in the `getblock` result and the
  `orchard.commitments.finalRoot` field in the `z_gettreestate` result  have
  been changed to match the byte ordering used for the `orchard.anchor`
  field in the `getrawtransaction` result. These previously produced different
  hash values from the `orchard.anchor` field due to having been byte-flipped
  in their internal representation in zcashd.
