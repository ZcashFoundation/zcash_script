# Sprout cache contents

This Sprout cache was created in 5d44ce318eb1916340e680b944b78cb5175468f9 by
`create_sprout_chains.py`, which was added in the same commit (and removed
shortly after). If changes are needed, the script can be updated and run from
that commit – it’s no longer possible to send funds to Sprout in the master
branch.

The cache contains one Sprout address per node on nodes [0..3]. Each address
contains a single 50 ZEC note.
