## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- Implemented the `Asm` trait and `Display` formatting for scripts and opcodes, enabling `asm`-style string representations similar to zcashd ([#256](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/256))


## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-25

This is a significant change, with a new Rust API that isn’t made to be swappable with the C++ API. The previous `ZcashScript`-based API is in the new `libzcash_script` crate.

### Removed

- The `cxx` module, `ZcashScript` trait, `ComparisonInterpreter`, `CxxInterpreter` structs, `Error` enum, `cxx_rust_comparison_interpreter` function, and `external-secp` feature have all moved to the new `libzcash_script` crate
- `check_verify_callback` has moved to the `testing` module in the new `libzcash_script` crate
- `normalize_error` has been removed, but there is a similar new function `testing::normalize_err` in the new `libzcash_script` crate
- `rust_interpreter` has been removed, but there is a similar `RustInterpreter` struct in the new `libzcash_script` crate
- `interpreter::State` no longer implements `Clone`
- All of the stepwise functionality (`ComparisonStepEvaluator`, `StepResults`, `StepwiseInterpreter`, `interpreter::DefaultStepEvaluator` (its re-export `DefaultStepEvaluator`), `stepwise_verify`, `interpreter::eval_step`, and `interpreter::StepFn`) has been removed
- The `interpreter::Stack` and `interpreter::State` operations have been removed
- `interpreter::CallbackTransactionSignatureChecker::verify_signature` has been removed
- `interpreter::CallbackTransactionSignatureChecker` is no longer re-exported as `CallbackTransactionSignatureChecker`
- `interpreter::SignatureChecker::check_sig` and `interpreter::SignatureChecker::check_lock_time` no longer have default impls


### Changed

- `interpreter::HashType` (its re-export `HashType`), `interpreter::InvalidHashType`, `interpreter::SignedOutputs` (and its re-export `SignedOutputs`) are now available only from the `signature` module
- `interpreter::BaseSignatureChecker` is now named `interpreter::NullSignatureChecker`
- `interpreter::eval_script` has been replaced by the `script::Code::eval` method
- `interpreter::verify_script` has been replaced by the `script::Raw::eval` method
- `interpterer::VerificationFlags` (and its re-export `VerificationFlags`) is now available only as `interpreter::Flags`
- `script_error::ScriptNumError` is now `num::Error`
- `script_error::ScriptError` is now `script::Error`, and its constructors have been split between that type, `opcode::Error`, `interpreter::Error`, and `signature::Error`. Many of the constructors of these types have changed – taking parameters, or combined or split into different specific cases.

### Added

- `interpreter::Error`, `opcode::Error`, and `signature::Error` have been added as subsets of `script::Error`
- script types `Script` and `script::Raw` have been added
- `script::Component` has been added
- The `pv` and `op` modules have been added
- The `pattern` module has been added with a number of functions for building scripts components
- The `script::Evaluable` and `opcode::Evaluable` traits have been added, with implementations for the relevant types
- script and component types have an `annotate` method for collecting potential issues with a script

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2) - 2025-06-24

- bump secp256k1 back to 0.29 (#234)
- add: Implement `Display` and derive `Error` traits for error enums (#231)

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) - 2025-05-17

### Other

- Remove extra `&` from `SighashCalculator` ([#216](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/216))

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) - 2025-05-13

- Another major API update. The previous C++ functions were moved to the `cxx`
  module. A new Rust implementation has been added. In the root of the
  crate there are now "Intepreters" which allow choosing which implementation
  to use.

- Eliminate `ScriptNum` ([#208](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/208))
- Add various stepwise functionality ([#204](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/204))
- Addressing post-hoc PR feedback on #174 ([#197](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/197))
- Expose `ScriptError` on C++ side ([#195](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/195))
- Change type of `lock_time` parameter ([#190](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/190))
- Initial Rust implementation ([#174](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/174))
- Add a basic rust-toolchain.toml ([#176](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/176))
- Address Str4d’s comments on #171 ([#175](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/175))
- Provide a Rustier wrapper for zcash_script ([#171](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcash_script/pull/171))

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-10

- Major API update. Most functions have been removed and a new callback-based
  function was introduced. See `depend/zcash/src/script/zcash_script.h` for
