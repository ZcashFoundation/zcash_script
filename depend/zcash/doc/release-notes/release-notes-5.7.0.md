Notable changes
===============

Deprecation of `fetch-params.sh`
--------------------------------

The `fetch-params.sh` script (also `zcash-fetch-params`) is now deprecated. The
`zcashd` binary now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly and so parameters do not
need to be downloaded or stored separately. The script will now do nothing but
state that it is deprecated; it will be removed in a future release.

Previously, parameters were stored by default in these locations:

* `~/.zcash-params` (on Linux); or
* `~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams` (on Mac); or
* `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams` (on Windows)

Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded
pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save
space as they are no longer read or used by `zcashd`. If you do wish to use the
Sprout pool, you will need the `sprout-groth16.params` file in the
aforementioned directory. This file is currently available for download
[here](https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params).

Mempool metrics
---------------

`zcashd` now reports the following new metrics when `-prometheusport` is set:

- (gauge) `zcash.mempool.actions.unpaid { "bk" = ["< 0.2", "< 0.4", "< 0.6", "< 0.8", "< 1"] }`
- (gauge) `zcash.mempool.actions.paid`
- (gauge) `zcash.mempool.size.weighted { "bk" = ["< 1", "1", "> 1", "> 2", "> 3"] }`

The `zcash.mempool.actions` metrics count the number of [logical actions] across
the transactions in the mempool, while `zcash.mempool.size.weighted` is a
weight-bucketed version of the `zcash.mempool.size.bytes` metric.

The [ZIP 317 weight ratio][weight_ratio] of a transaction is used to bucket its
logical actions and byte size. A weight ratio of at least 1 means that the
transaction's fee is at least the ZIP 317 conventional fee, and all of its
logical actions are considered "paid". A weight ratio lower than 1 corresponds
to the fraction of the transaction's logical actions that are "paid". The
remaining fraction (i.e. 1 - weight ratio) are subject to the unpaid action
limit that miners configure for their blocks with `-blockunpaidactionlimit`.

Changelog
=========

Daira Emma Hopwood (2):
      wallet_listreceived.py: fix an assertion message and remove unnecessary use of LEGACY_DEFAULT_FEE.
      Update ed25519-zebra to 4.0.0. This deduplicates sha2, rand-core, block-buffer, digest, and ahash. (It adds duplications for hashbrown and libm which are less important.)

      Ensure that the panic when Sprout parameters cannot be loaded says how to fix it by downloading them.

      Updates getblockcount help message to the appropriate message.
